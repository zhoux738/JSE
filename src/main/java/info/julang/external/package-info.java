/**
 * Package <b><code>info.julang.external</code></b> defines the interfaces and public-facing classes
 * that can be safely referenced and accessed by the users.
 * <p>
 * An instance of Julian script engine is supposed to run in an isolated realm within the confines of JVM runtime. 
 * This makes it possible for multiple engine instances running together without causing conflicts with each other
 * with regards to engine-wide shared resources and common facilities. One example of such resource is the statically
 * initialized built-in and foundation classes. The isolation is achieved by {@link EngineFactory}, which loads  
 * engine internals through {@link EngineComponentClassLoader a distinct class loader} that reverts the default 
 * delegation model.
 * <p>
 * The classes in this package, and its sub-packages, are the only classes (along with some utility classes) under 
 * prefix "info.julang" that can be directly referenced from the caller's world. For example, {@link 
 * EngineFactory} can be safely loaded from the default class loader, or whatever class loader that loads the user's 
 * class. In contrast, any attempt to cast the engine, components, and any of their derivatives created by this 
 * factory to a more concrete form, such as {@link info.julang.execution.simple.SimpleScriptEngine 
 * SimpleScriptEngine}, would fail due to the two classes not being loaded by the same class loader.
