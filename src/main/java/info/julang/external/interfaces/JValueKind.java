/**
 * The kind of JValue.
 * <p>
 * JValueKind provides a quicker way to help determine what a value holds. 
 * This is different from {@link info.julang.typesystem.JTypeKind JTypeKind}, which describes 
 * the type a value is of from the perspective of runtime context. For example, in code
 * <pre>
 * <code>
 *   class C {
 *     ... ...
 *   }
 *   C c = new C();
 * </code>
 * </pre>
 * The JValueKind of the value that holds c in stack is REFERENCE, since the actual value of c, which c
 * points to, is stored in heap. On the other hand, JTypeKind of c is OBJECT, reflecting what c is meant to
 * be in both original source code and VM runtime context.
