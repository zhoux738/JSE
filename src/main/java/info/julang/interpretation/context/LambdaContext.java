/**
 * The lambda context differs from other contexts in that it has a defining context, which
 * is the context in which this lambda is defined. For example, if a lambda is defined in
 * an instance method then it will have an {@link MethodContext instance method context};
 * If a lambda is defined in another lambda, then it will inherit the defining context from
 * the latter lambda. This means the defining context cannot be a LambdaContext itself.
