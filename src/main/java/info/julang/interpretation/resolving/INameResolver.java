/**
 * Name resolver is a context-sensitive class that is used to resolve an identifier encountered in script code. 
 * In Julian we have several different situations where the strategy for resolving identifiers can vary.
 * <p/>
 * <li>In the loose code, i.e. the code not present in method, the thread is running in a global environment and 
 * resolve names against a lexically scoped variable table. The bottom level of this table is the global variable 
 * table (<b>GVT</b>).
 * <li>Within the functions which are defined in loose code, we are resolving using two variables tables:
 * a local lexically scoped variable table (frame VT, or <b>FVT</b>) that belongs to the current frame, 
 * and <b>GVT</b>.
 * </li>
 * <li>For instance methods/constructors/initializers, the names are resolved against two parts: <b>FVT</b> 
 * and instance fields. And, of course, the special handling of 'this' is also included.
 * </li>
 * <li>For static methods and initializers, the names are resolved against two parts: <b>FVT</b> and class fields.
 * </li>
 * <br/><br/>
 * Name resolver is only used to resolve a simple name, but never a composite name, such as "a.b". This is because
 * for "a.b" it is either "a" getting resolved first by name resolver, in which case the part "b" will be interpreted
 * by {@link info.julang.interpretation.expression.operator.DotOp dot operator} ("."); or "a.b" getting 
 * resolved in entirety to be a type value by dot operator. Since name can be resolved either in name resolver or
 * by dot operator, the accessibility check must be performed at both places.
 * <br/><br/>
