/**
 * An interface to represent the script type a platform shall be mapped to.
 * <p>
 * At the point where we inspect and filter a platform type to get all the
 * members thereof we are to add to the mapped Julian type, it's possible 
 * that we don't know if a platform type we encounter can be successfully 
 * mapped, so we must encapsulate the information and defer the decision 
 * to a later stage while building the class. This extra layer of wrapping
 * is also needed even if the type is known to be mappable, but we are
 * yet unable to get a handle of its mapped Julian type. For example, a 
 * field with type being the class type itself is surely mappable:<pre><code> class Node {
 *   Node n;
 * }</code></pre>
 * But since we don't have {@link JType} instance for this very type, we 
 * can only use an abstract layer to carry the information down the road.
