 * IO continuation threads which are shared among all the asynchronous operations. This means 
 * blocking on an IO thread will potentially cause deadlocking for other unrelated threads.
 * <p>
 * The pool is empty at the start and will grow monotonically till the max capacity.

    /**
     * Fetch an IO continuation thread.
     * <p>
     * An IO-continuation thread is a special worker thread that handles asynchronously posted works 
     * from a platform callback after certain IO operations. For example, Java's async file API has 
     * a CompletionHandler class whose methods get invoked after a chunk of data has been read from 
     * the source. These methods will be running on a JVM worker thread that's likely different from 
     * the one where readAsync() was called. Some OSes, such as Windows, even have a dedicated thread 
     * pool for this purpose. How JVM is interacting with this underlying mechanism is irrelevant to 
     * our discussion here.
     * <p>
     * The main problem we are trying to solve here is that once the callback method is invoked, user's 
     * code will be running on a thread outside Julian's thread manager. Not only will this break 
     * threading API, it may also cause lingering thread after the termination of script engine. To 
     * remedy this, we must move the work from JVM-issued thread to our own thread.
     * <p>
     * IOThreadWrapper creates standard Julian thread that continuously polls a work queue and executes 
     * each work item inline. Exceptions thrown from work items won't break the thread.
     *   
     * @param rt The current thread runtime in which the IO thread is needed. However, a system thread
     * runtime will be created to access to the IO thread.
     * @param outOfCapacity If true, will create a new IO-continuation thread outside the pool. The 
     * caller is responsible for completing this thread after use.
